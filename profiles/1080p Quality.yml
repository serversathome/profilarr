  \ to target **transparent** x264 1080p encodes. \n- 5 Quality tiers prioritise encodes\
  \ with high 1080p GPPi scores, with fallback to 1080p WEB-DLs and streaming optimised\
  \ encodes (**BHDStudio & hallowed**).\n- If no 1080p release can be found, the profile\
  \ will fall back to SD releases - **DVD remuxes  / encodes**"
