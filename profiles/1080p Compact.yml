name: 1080p Compact
description: 'Do not Use. Soon I will be turning the Compact profile into the "junk"
  profile whereby restricting the sizes it takes considerably. Ideally targeting Movies
  at under 6gb and TV Shows at less then 1gb per ep. Adding in HDTV and SDTV for better
  compatibility with older movies and TV shows. If you are currently using the Compact
  profile I highly suggest switching over to the Efficient profile as they are very
  similar you shouldn''t notice much difference.


  Once this profile is ready to use again this message will change and revert back
  to the profile description.'
